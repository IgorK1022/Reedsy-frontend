SPA with Vue.js/Vuetify

## 1. About me

As a fan of Evan You, creator of Vue.js, I have done many projects with Vue.js

Here is one of them: www.uhomie.cl - Real Estate Agents site of Chile

Back-end: Laravel, Front-end: Vue.js

I worked as a front-end engineer on it

Here is another one built with Angular: www.app.perkpass.io


## 2. General

##### 2.1. What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?
Vue.js or Angualr.js

I prefer Vue.js because I am a fan of Vue.js

##### 2.2. Which are your favorite features of HTML5? How have you used them before?
Canvas, WebSocket
I have used them to build the chat app

##### 2.3. Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting `innerHTML` and using `createElement`.
We can recreates all DOM nodes inside the div element using innerHTML and simply append a new element to the div using create Element.

In other words, innerHTML is good fit for doing several things to an element but createElement is the more efficeint for appending a new element to the div

##### 2.4. Compare two-way data binding vs one-way data flow.
Two-way data binding means that UI fileds are bound to model data dynamically - a UI field changes, the model data changes with it and a model data changes, a UI field also changes However one way data flow means that only model data changes, a UI field changes

In front-end frameworks, two-way data binding are mostly used - we can do it using v-model and v-bind 

##### 2.5. Why is asynchronous programming important in JavaScript?
It's the only thing that allows you to do more than one things at the same time

## 3. Styling

#### Done
- Implement styling rules that consider different screen sizes.
- The footer should stick to the bottom when scrolling.
- You can, and should, use a CSS pre-processor, such as SASS or LESS.
